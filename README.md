# LinkedList

This is a basic implementation of a Linked List in C++, using object-oriented design principles.
The nodes in the list only store an integer data-type for simplicity.

All of the basic operations for Linked Lists are implemented including:

- Inserting at the beginning, at a specified index, and at the end of the List
- Deleting at the beginning, at a specified index, and at the end of the List
- Reading the value of any node in the List
- Changing the value of any node in the List
- Deleting every node from the Listt
- Printing the values of the entire List
- Reversing the List
- Searching the List for a specific value
